## What?

repoget clones all repositores and gists from a given
Github user name.

## Why

During OSINT investigations, you may want to see all logged events
in a repo with commands like `git log` and so on. This is only
possible if you clone the repo instead of just downloading it.

This script is also userful to just download everytihng from a
Github user handle, as a form of backup in case the person deletes
the account or someone takes it down for some reason.

## Installation

    # pip install PyGithub GitPython
    $ git clone https://github.com/merces/repoget.git
    $ cd repoget/

## Usage

Before using it, consider adding a Github
[Personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) to `repoget.py`,
otherwise you will be limited by the number of unauthenticated requests Github allows.

    $ python3 repoget.py <github_username>

## Example

Clone all repos and gists from `github.com/merces`:

```
$ python3 repoget.py merces
